# FRC characterization of the Romi robot

The files in this directory are based on those generated by the [frc-characterization](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/) tool.

As of Jan 2021, the frc-characterization tool failed to generate the Java project from the mako templates. Instead, I copied the template project directly from the frc-characterization repo and created a separate standalone script, called do-mako, which contained my Robot configuration and rendered the Robot.java.mako template.
